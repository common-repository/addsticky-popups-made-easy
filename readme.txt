You can get your own AddSticky account from [addsticky.com/wordpress/free](http://addsticky.com/wordpress/free) for free.
Once you have your account, create a AddSticky and simply paste your code into the plugin's text area.

= Should I load my AddSticky in the header or the footer of my WordPress site? =

This depends on your site. We recommend loading the script in the footer but if your page takes very long to load, the header might be a better location.
